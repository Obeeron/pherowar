v1.1
- Fixed a critical bug where removing/replacing a colony would not remove its ants references from the map data, confusing newly spawned colonies with ghost refs.
- Updated documentation and fixed inconsistencies with actual simulation.
- Changed 'intensity' to 'distance' in AntInput for `wall_sense`, `colony_sense`, `food_sense`, and `enemy_sense`. It now reflects the distance in tiles to the target and has value -1.0 when not sensing anything.
- Updated ANT_SPAWN_INTERVAL from 0.1 to 0.3
- Trigger a think tick when an ant enters food or colony
- Added ant's is_on_food and is_on_colony to debug panel
- Fixed a bug where you could not unpause after a colony won
- Fixed a bug where the colony tool could not be opened when all colonies were placed
- Changed shortcuts:
    - Changed Ctrl+R, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+L shortcuts to R, S, L respectively.
    - Added Spacebar as a shortcut to toggle pause/resume.
- Fixed the symmetry tool inverting the horizontal and vertical symmetry.
- Added a double diagonal symmetry tool.
- Fixed is_on_food. When the last food is taken, it is set to `false`.
- Saving a blank map now sets it as the current map, so resets restore the saved map.
- Updated placeholder placeholder for map name to current map name or "Untitled.map".
- Ant don't die on timeout, their think tick is just ignored and has no effect.
- Add CPU usage limit per container. 0.25 of the total CPU time available to the container.
- Set colony id based on lowest available id, avoid spamming with new log files.
- Renamed player logs from player_<colony_id>.log to <so_name>_<colony_id>_.log for easier identification.
- Fix real time stdout/stderr container logs in `Application/<so_name>_<colony_id>_.log`
